## Synopsis

This is a Python based GUI tool used to generate secure seeds for the IOTA protocol. It uses the "random.SystemRandom()" command for offline seed generation. Executable packages are available for Windows and Mac OS, along with the Python source code.

## Code Example

Current secure cryptography command: random.SystemRandom().choice(string.ascii_uppercase + "9") for _ in range(81))

## Motivation

At the moment IOTA lacks an official tool for creating seeds for personal use. In the mean time, seeds generated through Python are secure and simply done.

## Installation

If you do not have Python installed on your system, you can use the executables to run the GUI window. Currently there are executables for Windows and Mac OS.

## License

Free to use and modify.
